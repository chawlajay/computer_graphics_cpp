1. glutInit(&argc,argv);
-> glutInit is used to initialize the GLUT library.
-> argc -	A pointer to the program's unmodified argc variable from main. Upon return, the value pointed to by argc will be updated, 
	because glutInit extracts any command line options intended for the GLUT library.
-> argv - 	The program's unmodified argv variable from main. Like argc, the data for argv will be updated because glutInit extracts 
	any command line options understood by the GLUT library.
-> glutInit will initialize the GLUT library and negotiate a session with the window system. During this process, glutInit may cause 
	the termination of the GLUT program with an error message to the user if GLUT cannot be properly initialized. Examples 
	of this situation include the failure to connect to the window system, the lack of window system support for OpenGL, and 
	invalid command line options.
