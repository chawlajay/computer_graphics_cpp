1. glutInit(&argc,argv);
-> glutInit is used to initialize the GLUT library.
-> argc -	A pointer to the program's unmodified argc variable from main. Upon return, the value pointed to by argc will be updated, 
	because glutInit extracts any command line options intended for the GLUT library.
-> argv - 	The program's unmodified argv variable from main. Like argc, the data for argv will be updated because glutInit extracts 
	any command line options understood by the GLUT library.
-> glutInit will initialize the GLUT library and negotiate a session with the window system. During this process, glutInit may cause 
	the termination of the GLUT program with an error message to the user if GLUT cannot be properly initialized. Examples 
	of this situation include the failure to connect to the window system, the lack of window system support for OpenGL, and 
	invalid command line options.

2. glutInitDisplayMode( unsigned int mode ) - sets the basic display modes.  For more than one choice, OR the constants together.  
Usual mode constants are:

            GLUT_SINGLE - single buffering

            GLUT_DOUBLE - double buffering

            GLUT_RGB - set to full color mode

            GLUT_RGBA - same as RGB

            GLUT_INDEX - set color index mode

            GLUT_DEPTH - set up a depth buffer

3. a window is created with GLUT that will contain the viewport which displays the OpenGL front buffer with the following three lines:
	glutInitWindowSize( int width, int height ) - sets size of screen window in pixels

	glutInitWindowPosition( int x, int y ) - sets initial window position on the screen for upper left corner

	glutCreateWindow( char* title ) creates a top-level window labeled with title.

4. glutDisplayFunc( void (*func)(void) ) - sets the callback function, provided by your program, that GLUT will call when a window must 
be redisplayed (e.g. on resize).  Simply pass the name of a void function that takes no parameters.

5. glutMainLoop( ) - start the event loop; never returns.
