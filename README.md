# Computer Graphics using cpp
From installing IDE, graphics library, different function with code and syntax , I am uploading in here.
#1. Install Code::Blocks IDE from this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01mingw-setup.exe/download), which is easy to work with and computer graphics is old but basics of CG becomes clear using graphics.h library and its functions.
#2. We need to download header files for graphics to work in our machine. Download 3 files from [here](https://github.com/chawlajay/computer_graphics_cpp/graphics_library).
